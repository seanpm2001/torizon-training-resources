# TOR: Final considerations

## Torizon Bootcamp with Sergio Prado

### Final considerations

===

## CI/CD

* Continuous integration (CI) automates the building and testing of software.
* Continuous deployment (CD) is an extension of this automation, allowing the software to be deployed after every commit that passes the CI pipeline.
* Both are part of the DevOps approach to building faster and better software:
  * Less manual work & more productivity.
  * Fewer bugs & better quality.
  * Avoid delays & improved response time.

## CI/CD in Torizon

* To help users with implementing DevOps best practices, Torizon is built with these concepts in mind!
* It is recommended to implement a CI/CD-first approach when customizing Torizon OS images and developing containerized applications.
* By implementing a CI/CD pipeline, one can automate every step in the process, from merging a commit to deploying the new software to production!
* Se the [official documentation](https://developer.toradex.com/torizon/application-development/ide-extension/#cicd-workflow) on how to implement a CI/CD pipeline.
